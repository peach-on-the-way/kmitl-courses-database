# What?
This repository is used to store all possible information related to all courses from the KMITL curriculum.

# Why?
The website provided by the university is not user-friendly. This repository scrapes most the data (This is done manually at the momment) and the data will be used to provide a better experience usually for add/drop and schedule management.

# How?
A GUI application is in work to utilize the data.
